Welcome to the Django Recipe Manager! This project is designed to help users create and manage their favorite recipes. The application consists of two main apps - recipes and users.

Features

Recipe Storage: All created recipes are stored in an SQLite3 database for easy retrieval and management.

User Authentication: The users app handles user authentication, ensuring that each user can manage their own set of recipes.
